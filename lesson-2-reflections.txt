Lesson 2 reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You turn a regular file into a repository, which is a special type of
	folder. It creates the .git file which will track commits and contains
	metadata about the files in the repository. If you didn't initialize,
	you couldn't commit.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a temporary limbo where files from the directory go
	before they get committed to the repository. It offers organization.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
